## What is p5.toio?
**p5.toio** is a library for [toioâ„¢](https://toio.io/) in p5.js environment. A lot of APIs on toio can be used with just simple steps as we see later. Now I released an `alpha-version(0.5.0)` so that there is no test code, detailed API document or samples yet. Please wait for the next `beta-version(0.8.0)` releaseðŸ˜‰.

Source codes are publised on [GitHub](https://github.com/tetunori/p5.toio/) and released under MIT License.

## Class Structure
**p5.toio** consists of 2 classes `P5tCube` and `P5tId`. `P5tCube` class supplies a lot of APIs and utilities enable us to control toioâ„¢Core Cube easily. Please refer to the `P5tCube` class interfaces from [here](https://tetunori.github.io/p5.toio/docs/classes/_p5tcube_.p5tcube.html). `P5tId` class includes APIs and properties on toioIDs printed on toioâ„¢'s mats, cards, stickers and so on. See interfaces from [here](https://tetunori.github.io/p5.toio/docs/classes/_p5tid_.p5tid.html) for `P5tId`.
